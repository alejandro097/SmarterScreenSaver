# SmarterScreenSaver
SmarterScreenSaver is a lightweight Windows utility that "intelligently" manages your screensaver. It's especially beneficial for OLED displays, helping prevent burn-in by activating the screensaver when appropriate while staying out of your way during active media consumption.

## 🌟 Features
- **Smart Media Detection** – Automatically detects media playback from whitelisted applications

## 🖥️ Perfect for OLED Displays
OLED displays are susceptible to burn-in when static content remains on screen for extended periods. **SmarterScreenSaver** helps protect your monitor by:

- Activating screensavers during idle periods  
- Respecting active media playback to avoid interruptions  
- Providing configurable timing to match your usage patterns  
- Working seamlessly in the background

## 🚀 How It Works
**SmarterScreenSaver monitors:**
- **System idle time** – Detects when you're away from your computer  
- **Media activity** – Detects actual media playback, not just open applications  
- **Grace periods** – Provides buffer time for media transitions and loading  

**The screensaver activates only when:**
1. System has been idle beyond the threshold  
2. No whitelisted applications are playing media  
3. Grace period has expired after media stops
